# Ibrahim Abu Kharmeh

Ibrahim currently works as a **Silicon Design Engineer** for **AMD** in Cambridge.  
Previously, he worked on implementing **D-cache controllers** using the **Chisel** language and their models using the **SST framework** in **C++**.  
He also evaluated **RISC-V** code and **CHERI on RISC-V** to identify optimization opportunities and implemented them in **SystemVerilog**.

He holds an **Electronics Engineering MSc** from the **University of Southampton**, where he designed a novel **NISC-based processor** for Fast Fourier Transform and a **RISC processor** for Affine Transform.  
Prior to that, he served as a **HW/SW engineer** at **Gemini 2000 LTD**.
